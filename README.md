# MongoAS3 ExamplesThese examples show how to get started using the MongoAS3 library with a MongoDB server. The examples are written using 'localhost' as the MongoDB server. For deployment the host can be changed to a remote IP address. However, a socket policy file server will have to be deployed to that MongoDB server so Flash clients can connect to the MongoDB port (27017 by default). The MongoAS3 project has an example written in PHP.Examples--------Below is a list of most basic MongoDB examples.
